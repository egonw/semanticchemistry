Draft agenda for the planned teleconference of the semantic chemistry working group being held on the 17th December 2009 at 1600 UK time. 

= Topic: automatic classification =

1) ChEBI machine learning classifier

(Nikolas Fechner and Georg Hinselmann, Tuebingen University)

Abstract: we developed an unsupervised machine learning approach to the ontology classification problem using a maximum likelihood classification. In the training phase each ontology node is assigned a prefix search tree that contains all labeled paths (intramolecular atom sequences) up to a specific length that are present in all  molecules  belonging to the ontological class defined by this node. If the node is a leaf in the ontology graph (i.e. it has no ontological children) the full prefix depth-first-search tree, similar to a Daylight fingerprint, is assigned to it. In the other cases a consensus tree is constructed which solely consists of the paths present in the trees of the children. Those can be either consensus trees or full depth-first search trees.
The prediction of the ontological map of a new molecule consists of a comparison of the molecules depth-first search tree with all consensus trees in the ontology giving a probabilistic score for each  tree which denotes  how likely  the similarity of the consensus tree or the molecule tree is. This score depends on the complexity of a pattern trees and depends on the length of the paths and the atom type sequence. For example a “C-C-C” sequence is more likely than a “C-S-C” sequence. The resulting ranking serves as a guidance at which place in the ontology the new compound can be placed.
In future experiments, we will improve the scoring scheme and test alternative chemical similarity measures such as graph-matching kernels.


2) DL-based classification by composition: state of the art?

What is the latest on the work originally started by Michel on classification by functional groups in OWL? 


3) Combined approaches

E.g. combination of DL-based and similarity-based classification strategies. DL-based can be used to give an entry point for machine learning approaches, to narrow the search space for classification.
