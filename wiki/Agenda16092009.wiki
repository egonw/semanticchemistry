#summary Agenda for teleconference 16092009

= Polycyclic cages =

Polycyclic cages logical definition. I've got this working now using a formalisation of molecules as tuples of (atoms, bonds, rings) where the rings are generated by the CDK SSSRFinder. A fixed restriction on the number of bonds each ring in the ring set must share with other rings (three, four, ...) in the ringset doesn't work, but, a restriction relative to the number of atoms in the ring does: specifically, if the ring is composed of n atoms, the number of bonds that must be shared to ensure that overall the structure forms a cage is (n-1). The prolog source and detailed comments are attached to the issue on google code (http://code.google.com/p/semanticchemistry/issues/detail?id=1). What I still need to do is prune the search space more rigorously to fail faster when a cage is *not* detected.

= SMARTS =

SMARTS annotation of classes and functional groups. I'm going to run the MarvinBeans SMARTS generation on a selected subset of ChEBI ontology branches and will report back on the results.

= Ontology =

Building a collaborative ontology for terminology related to QSAR / chemical data / drug discovery *etc*: what tools? Shall we try to use collaborative Protégé? We could start already on the areas which are orthogonal to Nico's / Egon's existing work and get a framework, ID space and those technicalities sorted out.

= Automatic classification =

Consensus structural keys: our visitors Niko and Georg can tell us about their work with fingerprint trees and building consensus keys for classes.

= Text mining roles =

Bioactivity and ChEBI "roles". Here are some examples of the ChEMBL descriptions of assays from which we wish to extract (*) has-role assertions. In each case "the compound" is linked in the database to a specific structure. I plan to try out a naive approach here initially: search for a given set of regular expressions ("against *", "* activity", ...) and match on existing ChEBI "role" terms (inhibitor, agonist), and evaluate the percentage successful coverage. Suggestions welcome.
