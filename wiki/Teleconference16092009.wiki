1. Polycyclic cages. Prolog-based reasoner for FOL representation using the ring systems detected with the CDK SSSRFinder now works; conclusion is that this construction can be defined with logic but not smarts; since smarts doesn't contain a representation for the forall operator. 

2. Leo presented his work on consensus functional groups for lipid classification. 

3. Georg presented his and Niko's work on consensus fingerprints for classes for classification in ChEBI. 

4. We discussed collaborative editing of a cheminformatics/QSAR/drug discovery ontology. Action point for Nico: send around options for tools other than Protege. It was highlighted that use cases for the ontology are essential to focus development. Action point for Janna: create page on Wiki where we gather use cases. Action point for others: gather use cases.

The page for collecting use cases has now been added here: [UseCasesCheminformaticsOntology]. Please go and add your use cases.
