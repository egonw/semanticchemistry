#summary Minutes of semantic chemistry workgroup meeting held 12 March 2010

= Topic =

Cheminf ontology progress and next steps

= Present =
Michel, Egon, Leo, Janna

= Agenda =

1. ontology - OBO

2. algorithms

3. annotated data

= Minutes =
due to audio setup problems, meeting starts 10:30EST

1. ontology
 ontology submitted to OBO
 
*ACTION ITEM*: michel to figure out how to get CHEMINF redirection from OBO library purl

 not OBO foundry until larger community
 
*ACTION ITEM*: submit to NCBO bioportal

 leo: do we have proper coverage of CDK, OpenBabel? 

*ACTION ITEM*: leo to confirm CDK & OpenBabel coverage.

 egon: CDK descriptors are in 
   http://qsar.svn.sf.net/viewvc/qsar/trunk/qsar-dicts/descriptor-implementations.owl?revision=213&view=markup

*ACTION ITEM*: egon to find one descriptor that fits into multiple categories

 egon: atomic/bond/molecular descriptors
 michel: these are automatically categorized due to 'aboutness' relation

 egon: QSAR community uses 0D,1D,2D,3D,4D,5D descriptors, how does this play?
*ACTION ITEM*: egon to give some examples for next call

 leo: suggests to find a list, if such a list exists

 michel: think about categorization for leaf nodes directly under "chemical descriptor" - would be nice to have additional info.

*ACTION ITEM*: ALL to think about this.

 egon: add electronic descriptor
 egon: add topological descriptor
 egon: add geometric descriptor

2. algorithms
 janna: need to be clear between descriptor and algorithm
 leo: the algorithm/implementation not specific

*ACTION ITEM*: egon to create N3 file of algorithms linking to descriptors
 
 janna: need to get list of implementations (CDK/OpenBabel/OEChem/Daylight/MOE/JOELIB/cinfony)
 
 egon: cinfony uses particular parameters, or process to derive descriptor values
 
 egon: BODO has "is modification of"/"derived from" -> how to include in CHEMINF
 michel: defined class

3. annotated data
 janna: need reasonable size subset
 egon: calculate a number of descriptors for 

4. Egon's acs - rdf meeting -> should we put together a paper?
  end of march.
 janna: having triple store & asking questions.
 leo: link sadi services with calculation of CHEMINF properties is really what we should strive for.
