#summary Descriptors to Include
= Task at Hand =

We would like to verify that we have full coverage of the descriptors calculated by the major cheminformatics packages. For this purpose, we need to compile an exhaustive list of descriptors used (by going to the API documentation if necessary), determine whether these descriptors are present in our descriptor ontology, and add them in appropriate classes if necessary.

When adding descriptors to the cheminf ontology, please keep track of which package the descriptor identity is coming from. Since some packages may name different descriptors the same name, we need to discuss ways of appropriately addressing this.
